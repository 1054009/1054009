Gettysburg, what an unbelievable battle that was. The battle of Gettysburg. What an unbelievable.
I mean, it was so much and so interesting and so vicious and horrible and so beautiful in so many different ways.
It, it represented such a big portion of the success of this country.

Gettysburg, wow.

I go to Gettbysburg, Pennsylvania, to look and to watch.And uh, the statement of Robert E. Lee, who’s no longer in favor.
Did you ever notice that? No longer in favor. “Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill.” They were fighting uphill.
He said, “wow, that was a big mistake.” He lost his great general. And, uh, they were fighting.

“Never fight uphill, me boys!” But it was too late.
